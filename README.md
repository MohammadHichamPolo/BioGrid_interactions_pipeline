# BioGrid_interactions_pipeline
## Abstract:
The study focuses on developing a computational pipeline to extract and visualize gene interactions, showcasing its utility through the analysis of the fimH gene. The pipeline integrates the BioGRID database via its API to retrieve genetic interaction data, preprocesses it, and generates interactive visualizations to highlight significant relationships. Results demonstrate 9 gene interactions for fimH, with notable positive and negative genetic interactions. The findings underscore the pipeline’s potential for large-scale genomic studies, particularly in identifying functional relationships between genes. The approach can be applied to other genes of interest, contributing to research in systems biology and functional genomics.
## Introduction
### Background
Gene interactions are critical for understanding the functional relationships and networks within biological systems. These interactions can be broadly categorized into:
*Physical interactions:* Direct binding or association between proteins.
*Genetic interactions:* Functional dependencies between genes where mutations or perturbations in one gene impact the phenotype of another.
Such analyses are pivotal in fields like functional genomics, systems biology, and disease research, as they reveal how genes cooperate in pathways and processes.
The fimH gene, a well-studied adhesin gene associated with uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), plays a critical role in bacterial adherence to host cells during infections, particularly in the urinary tract. Its interactions with other genes are crucial for understanding its regulatory mechanisms, functional partnerships, and its potential as a therapeutic target.
### Objective
This report aims to develop and implement a computational pipeline for extracting and visualizing gene interaction data using public repositories like BioGRID.
Demonstrate the pipeline’s utility using the fimH gene as a case study.
Highlight the interactions of fimH, including positive and negative genetic interactions, and discuss their biological significance.

5.⁠ ⁠Pipeline Implementation
5.1 Workflow Description

The computational pipeline consists of three main stages:

Data Retrieval:
The pipeline fetches interaction data for the queried gene (e.g., fimH) using the BioGRID API.
A GET request is sent to the API endpoint with the required parameters, such as the gene name, format, and API key.
Data Processing:
The JSON response received from the API is parsed and converted into a Python dictionary for further processing.
The interactors (Interactor A and Interactor B) are extracted and structured into a usable format, such as a pandas DataFrame or a simple edge list.
Redundant or missing entries are handled, ensuring clean and reliable data.
Visualization:
The processed interaction data is visualized as a network graph using libraries such as NetworkX (for graph modeling) and Matplotlib (for plotting).
Nodes in the graph represent genes or proteins, and edges represent their interactions.
Graph aesthetics (node size, color, edge thickness) can be adjusted for clarity and insight.

5.3 Error Handling and Challenges

Potential Issues:
Missing or Incomplete Data:
The BioGRID API may return entries with missing fields or undefined interactions.
Solution:
Use data validation checks during the extraction step to filter out incomplete records.
Example:

if "OFFICIAL_SYMBOL_A" in details and "OFFICIAL_SYMBOL_B" in details:
    interactors.append((details["OFFICIAL_SYMBOL_A"], details["OFFICIAL_SYMBOL_B"]))
API Failures:
Errors such as timeouts, invalid parameters, or rate-limiting can interrupt the pipeline.
Solution:
Implement error handling and retry mechanisms using try-except blocks.
try:
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
Large Data Size:
Large query results may lead to excessive memory usage or slow processing.
Solution:
Use batch processing or limit the number of returned records using API parameters.
Challenges Encountered:
Parsing complex JSON responses with nested fields.
Addressed by carefully inspecting the JSON structure and extracting the necessary keys.
Visual clutter in large interaction networks.
Resolved by optimizing the layout, adjusting node size, and filtering low-confidence interactions.
By implementing robust error handling and optimized processing, the pipeline ensures reliability and efficiency, even with large or complex datasets.
6. Case Study: Analysis of the fimH Gene
6.1 Biological Context

The fimH gene encodes the FimH adhesin protein, a key component of the type 1 fimbriae in Escherichia coli (E. coli). It is primarily associated with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), where it plays a critical role in bacterial adhesion to host tissues.
